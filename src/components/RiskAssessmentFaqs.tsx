                    As health providers, nothing is more important to us
                    than to have you avoid cancer. As thought leaders in
                    dentistry, this assessment questionnaire is an
                    artificial intelligence (Bayesian modeling) driven risk
                    assessment instrument to determine your personal risk of
                    oral and throat cancer, based on your individual
                    demographic and clinical characteristics. Using the
                    information you provide, this algorithm will determine
                    whether a state-of-the-art molecular saliva test called
                    CancerDetect is recommended. We also show you the more
                    precise personal risk assessment you obtain if you
                    proceed with the recommended Viome CancerDetect
                    <sup>®</sup> test.

                <div>
                    According to the American Cancer Society, more than
                    54,000 new oral and throat cancer cases are diagnosed
                    yearly in the US. Unfortunately, early detection
                    technology was limited in the past, resulting in only
                    28% of patients receiving an early diagnosis. This is a
                    significant concern, given that those diagnosed in the
                    early stages have a 44% higher survival rate than those
                    diagnosed in the late stages. About 11.5 adults per
                    100,000 will develop oral cancer, but the prevalence of
                    oral cancers is expected to increase by almost
                    two-thirds by 2035. Unfortunately, current early
                    detection methods are limited, resulting in significant
                    morbidity and mortality, as most people are asymptomatic
                    and diagnosed in the late stages of the disease.
                    However, with new technology emerging, we can now detect
                    oral and throat cancer earlier than ever before, which
                    can help prevent the disease from progressing to a late
                    stage.

                        It is important to understand that increasing age
                        alone is an important risk factor even if there are
                        no other risk factors. The NIH states that the
                        increase in incidence becomes more rapid after age
                        50, particularly for adults aged 65 years and older
                        (based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
                        Results (SEER) program). The American Cancer Society
                        identifies age as a risk factor, and states that
                        most patients with these cancers are older than 55
                        when the cancers are first found. Accordingly, oral
                        cancer screening is recommended for early detection
                        in people over 50 years of age.

                        The situation with oral and throat cancer is similar
                        to the higher incidence of Colorectal cancer for
                        adults over 45 years, for whom the American Cancer
                        Society recommends regular screening starting at age

                        Tobacco use in all its forms such as vaping, tobacco
                        pouches, and use of other tobacco products increase
                        your risk of oral and throat cancer. See the FAQ on
                        tobacco use for more information.

                    <p>
                        Consuming alcoholic drinks also increases your risk
                        – consuming moderately, up to four drinks a week,
                        can increase your risk substantially, and heavy
                        drinking increases your risk by a lot. See the FAQ

                        (oral and throat) cancers in the United States. See

                        Yes, it is generally recommended that you get
                        tested. Tobacco users face a staggering 1000% higher
                        risk of oral cancer compared to those who don't use
                        tobacco. The surgeon general's report concluded that
                        the evidence is sufficient to infer a causal
                        relationship between smoking and oral, and throat
                        cancer.

                    Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
                    transmitted infection in the United States. HPV can
                    infect the mouth and throat and cause cancer. There are
                    more than a 100 subtypes, but the ones that are relevant
                    to oral & throat cancer include HPV6, HPV11, HPV16,
                    HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, and HPV35 variants. Also, your
                    dentist may be able to identify intra-oral papillomas.
                    To dive deeper into the connection between HPV and these
                    cancers,

                    test is a simple and revolutionary saliva-based cancer
                    biomarker detection test that has been granted FDA
                    breakthrough designation for accelerated review. This
                    screening test is intended as a diagnostic aid for
                    clinicians suspecting oral squamous cell cancer and
                    oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, who may benefit
                    from follow-up early diagnosis and treatment. It is not
                    intended to provide a definitive diagnosis. Please note
                    that based on your personal risk factors and your
                    consent, only a licensed healthcare provider can order
                    the CancerDetect<sup>®</sup> saliva testing.
