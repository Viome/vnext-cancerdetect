If a signature for oral and/or throat cancer is detected, you will receive a call from a healthcare provider who will guide you to the next steps.</p><p class='mt-4'>The test is not intended for definitive diagnosis and should be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical data available to the clinician and relevant guidelines on the decision for confirmatory diagnosis, such as a biopsy.</p>"

        "CancerDetect - Oral & Throat is a lab-developed test (LDT) performed in our Clinical Laboratory located in Bothell, Washington. The Laboratory is designed to meet all federal and state regulatory, quality and CLIA criteria. The test is intended for use as a diagnostic aid in the detection of molecular features associated with OSCC and/or OPSCC. The test is 90% OSCC sensitive, 90% OPSCC sensitive and has a specificity of 95%.¹",
        "The CancerDetect - Oral & Throat test is recommended for use in adults with an elevated risk for oral & throat cancer such as those aged 50 or older or individuals who have a history of smoking, chewing tobacco, vaping, or using other forms of tobacco, heavy alcohol drinkers, or individuals with a high risk of HPV. The CancerDetect - Oral & Throat test does not detect all cancers and should be used in addition to routine cancer tests recommended by a healthcare provider. CancerDetect- Oral & Throat is intended to detect molecular features associated with cancer of the oral cavity or throat.",
        "Results should be interpreted in the context of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms. A test result of \"NOT DETECTED\" does not rule out cancer, and best practices may recommend testing again after a period of time. A test result of \"DETECTED\" requires confirmatory diagnostic evaluation by medically established procedures (e.g., imaging or biopsy) to confirm cancer. False-positive (a cancer signal detected when cancer is not present) and false-negative (a cancer signal not detected when cancer is present) test results do occur, as described in our scientific information."
