                                is a detection test for salivary biomarkers
                                associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma
                                (OSCC) and/or oropharyngeal squamous cell
                                carcinoma (OPSCC). The test has been
                                validated to detect molecular features that
                                are associated with OSCC and/or OPSCC. The
                                specificity of the test is 95%, and the
                                sensitivity 90% for subjects with OSCC and
                                90% for subjects with OPSCC1. The underlying
                                cancer biomarker detection test has been
                                granted FDA breakthrough device for

                                detection of OSCC and OPSCC. The device is
                                intended as a diagnostic aid for clinicians
                                with suspected OSCC or OPSCC who may benefit
                                from follow-up diagnosis and treatment. The

                                It is important to note that in a small

                                the oral cavity, or lump in the neck. This
                                is due to the specificity of the
                                CancerDetect test being 95%, which means
                                that up to 5% of DETECTED test results may
                                be false positives. In these cases, the
                                patient should consult with their provider
                                and continue testing regularly at the normal
